This is a homework assignment for bootcamp on using APIs, Mapping, Pandas and Python. 


## WeatherPy Analysis

Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated.
Create multiple scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude and other columns of the dataframe. 
Create a function that allows you to quickly generate scatter plots between two pandas columns, include information about regression
information in the output. There is a short analysis based on the regression information from multiple scenarios run using the function.

## VacationPy Analysis

Create multiple maps on new dataframes, including a dataframe that limits locations to my ideal weather patterns.
